          <h3>How We Lived</h3>
          <p>The effects of the pandemic didn't just change our economy, and it didn't just change our healthcare
            either. It even changed the very way we lived our lives.
            We saw lockdowns, restrictions, government payment packages and the rise in work from home jobs just to name
            a few examples. This page looks at some further examples
            of how the pandemic changed our way of life.

              of 2020</h3>
            <p>With lockdowns beginning to ease in October of 2020, Victorians started once again partaking in
              activities they had
              not enjoyed for some time. Whilst some activities, such as shopping in stores, ordering takeaway, going to
              parks and
              working from home stayed relatively the same, more close-contact actvities such as using public transport,
              visiting
              bars and attending social gatherings of more than 10 people skyrocketed in attendance once the lockdown
              was lifted.</p>

            <h3>The bar chart above provides a breakdown of how JobKeeper stimulus payments were used in 2020.</h3>
            <p>JobKeeper allowed many businesses to stay afloat, and allowed many families to put food on their tables.
              The
              necessity of this payment is clearly shown in this chart, very few people used the stimulus for less
              necessary
              expenses such as recreation and home improvement. Certainly the vast majority of this stimulus payment's
              funds
              helped people keep a roof above their head, food on their table and power in their homes.</p>


            <p>Note: Respondents may have reported more than one use of the stimulus payment</p>
