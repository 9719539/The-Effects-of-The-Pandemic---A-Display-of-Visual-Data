          <h3>Show Me the Money</h3>
          <p>With radical changes to the global economic climate came global changes to expenditure. Decisions and
            delegations regarding money had
            to take many new things into account. Questions were asked, how do we keep people employed? How can those
            unable to work continue to feed
            their families? Where should economic resources be focused? Many questions arose during these times, and
            many changes were made. The data
            visualisations below aim to demonstrate two powerful examples of how the economy was impacted by the scale
            of the Covid 19 Pandemic.

              Australia, Italy, New Zealand, Great Britain, America and China</h3>
            <p>The pandemic was felt globally, and affected each nation differently. In this chart we see that no two
              GDP changes were the same, whilst some, such as Italy and Great Britain shared similarities in their
              trends,
              others experienced unique trends, like New Zealand's near-plateau, and USA's sudden drop. Interestingly,
              Australia experienced significant growth from 2019 to 2020, having the highest year on year increase for
              2020 despite a significant decrease in 2019.</p>

            <p>It is well known that Italy was heavily impacted by the affects of Covid-19. Whilst their economy
              worked to recover from the devastating impacts of the virus, the wages of the average person were not
              spared from economic damage. For comparison, a chart of Australia's wage growth has been included,
              whilst we may have struggled through lockdowns, our wages remained strong and even experienced growth.</p>
