          <h3>A Diagnosis of Healthcare</h3>
          <p>Our hospitals and medical clinics faced an unprecedented wave of changes as they moved to adapt to a new
            challenge not seen in decades. Changes
            were made to how our hopsitals were run, what was prioritised, how resources were managed and even the
            administration of new and returning staff.
            As hospitals adapted and changed their approach, the data they left behind truly demonstrated just how
            impactful the pandemic was on our
            healthcare system.

            <p>With hospitals almost overflowing and clinics performing seemingly endless phone consultations to unwell
              patients,
              the health sector experienced drastic pressure from the effects of Covid-19. Retired health professionals
              were incentivised
              to return to work, whilst some students were given the opportunity to receive hands-on experience by
              helping in the busy hospitals.
              It really was a unique time for healthcare, and the data shows an enormous proportion of the healthcare
              sector was made up by practicing nurses, real life heroes many would say are the backbone of our hospitals
              and bravely put themselves at risk during the pandemic to ensure people received the care they needed to
              deal with the immense toll of the coronavirus.</p>
